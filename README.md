# Google Drive API Integration using React + TypeScript

This project is a React and TypeScript application built with Vite, integrating with the Google Drive API to read and write files.

## Introduction

This application demonstrates how to integrate the Google Drive API into a React application built with Vite and TypeScript. It allows users to authenticate with Google, create files, and list files in their Google Drive.

**Authentication Method**: This project uses the **Google Identity Services (GIS)** library for OAuth 2.0 authentication. The required scripts are loaded in the `index.html` file and must be included in any project implementing this authentication/service pattern.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **npm**: Version 6 or higher
- **Google Account**: Required for setting up Google API credentials

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nunocpt/google-drive-api.git
cd google-drive-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Google API Credentials

To use the Google Drive API, you need to set up a project in the Google Cloud Console and obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials.

**Important**: This project uses **Google Identity Services (GIS)** for authentication. Before setting up credentials, ensure that both the GIS and Google API scripts are included in your project's `index.html` file (see [index.html Script Configuration](#indexhtml-script-configuration) below).

#### a. Create a New Project

1. **Go to** the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. **Sign in** with your Google account if you haven't already.
3. **Click** on the project dropdown at the top of the page and select **New Project**.
4. **Enter** a project name (e.g., `My React App`) and **click** **Create**.

#### b. Enable the Google Drive API

1. **Navigate to** **APIs & Services > Library** in the left sidebar.
2. **Search for** **Google Drive API** in the search bar.
3. **Click** on **Google Drive API** from the search results.
4. **Click** on the **Enable** button.

#### c. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

1. **Go to** **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. **Select** **External** for the user type and **click** **Create**.
3. **Fill out** the required fields:
   - **App Name**: Your application's name.
   - **User Support Email**: Your email address.
   - **Developer Contact Information**: Your email address.
4. **Click** **Save and Continue**.
5. **Scopes**: Click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
   - **Add** the following scope:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
6. **Click** **Update** and then **Save and Continue** through the remaining steps.
7. **Back on the OAuth consent screen**, make sure to **Publish** the app if required.

#### d. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID

1. **Navigate to** **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. **Click** on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
3. **Choose** **Web Application** as the application type.
4. **Enter** a name for the client (e.g., `React App Client`).
5. **Under** **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, **add**:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (adjust if your development server runs on a different port)
6. **Leave** **Authorized Redirect URIs** empty (unless specifically needed).
7. **Click** **Create**.
8. **Copy** the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

#### e. Obtain an API Key (Optional)

While GAPI can theoretically work with just an Auth Token, providing an API Key is recommended to handle quota management and public file access reliably.

1. **In** **APIs & Services > Credentials**, **click** on **Create Credentials** and select **API key**.
2. **Copy** the generated **API Key**.

### 4. Create the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store environment variables.

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

- **Replace** `your-google-client-id` with the **Client ID** obtained from the Google Cloud Console.
- **Replace** `your-google-api-key` with the **API Key** if you obtained one. If not using an API key, you can omit this line or leave it empty.

**Important**: Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

### 5. Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

## index.html Script Configuration

**Critical Step**: This project requires two external Google scripts to be included in your `index.html` file. These scripts must be present for authentication and API operations to function correctly.

In the `<head>` section of your `index.html`, include:

```html
<!-- Google Identity Services (GIS) - Required for OAuth 2.0 Authentication -->
<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>

<!-- Google API Client Library - Required for Google Drive API Operations -->
<script src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js" async defer></script>
```

**Important**: If you're implementing this authentication/service pattern in another project, you **must** include these exact script tags in your project's `index.html` file. Without these scripts, authentication will fail and API operations will not work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`**: Runs the app in development mode with hot module replacement.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally for preview.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint (if configured).
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the codebase using Prettier (if configured).

---

## Additional Configuration

### Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured with your Google credentials:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

Restart your development server after updating environment variables for changes to take effect.

### Using Bootstrap (Optional)

This project includes Bootstrap for styling components. Bootstrap CSS is already installed as a dependency.

To use Bootstrap in your application, import the Bootstrap CSS in your `src/main.tsx` file:

```tsx
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

You can then use Bootstrap utility classes and components directly in your JSX.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

- **Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property** like this:

  ```js
  // eslint.config.js
  export default {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    },
    // ...other configurations
  };
  ```

- **Replace** `eslint:recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking` in your ESLint configuration.
- **Install `eslint-plugin-react`** and update the config:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react
  ```

  ```js
  // eslint.config.js
  module.exports = {
    // ...other configurations
    plugins: ['react'],
    extends: [
      // ...other extends
      'plugin:react/recommended',
    ],
    settings: {
      react: {
        version: 'detect',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

- **Optionally**, add `eslint-config-prettier` to disable ESLint rules that might conflict with Prettier:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
  ```

  ```js
  // eslint.config.js
  module.exports = {
    // ...other configurations
    extends: [
      // ...other extends
      'eslint:recommended',
      'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
      'plugin:react/recommended',
      'prettier',
    ],
  };
  ```

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Google Identity Services & API Scripts

- **Scripts Not Loading**: If authentication fails or the Google API is unavailable, verify that both scripts in `index.html` are properly loaded. Check browser console for CORS or network errors.
- **Script Loading Order**: Ensure the GIS script (`https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client`) is loaded before attempting to use `window.google.accounts.id`.
- **Replication Required**: When implementing this pattern in a new project, **you must include both scripts in your `index.html` file**. Simply copying the service files is not sufficient.

### General Troubleshooting

- **Environment Variables**: Remember to restart your development server after changing environment variables.
- **OAuth Consent Screen**: If you encounter an "Unverified App" warning, you may need to publish your app or add test users in the OAuth consent screen settings.
- **API Quotas**: Monitor your API usage in the Google Cloud Console to ensure you stay within free tier limits.
- **Multiple Google Accounts**: If you're signed into multiple Google accounts, ensure you're granting permissions with the correct account.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure that your `Authorized JavaScript origins` in the Google Cloud Console match the origin from which your app is served (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local development).
